-- OceanBase MySQL tenant: executable HammerDB TPROC-C benchmark tuning.
-- OceanBase tuning recommendations adapted for HammerDB TPROC-C.
-- These are benchmark candidates, not measured HammerDB improvements or
-- production defaults. Check parameter availability on your OceanBase version.
-- Sourcing this file records current settings, then applies the profile below.
-- Connect as an administrator of the BUSINESS tenant (e.g. root@hammerdb),
-- not root@sys. Do not apply this file to the OCP metadata tenant.
-- Save the output below before changing anything; restore the recorded values
-- after the experiment. Do not assume that product defaults are your baseline.
-- Example: obclient ... --batch < tprocc-tuning.sql > tuning-before.txt

-- 1. BUILD / STATISTICS COLLECTION
-- Start with a bounded 600-second QUERY timeout for HammerDB builds/statistics;
-- this is a HammerDB example limit, not a performance knob.
-- SET GLOBAL affects new connections; SET SESSION affects this SQL connection.
-- HammerDB explicitly overrides ob_query_timeout in every connection, so also
-- set Connection > Query timeout to 600 seconds, then reload the build driver.
-- CLI equivalent BEFORE buildschema/loadscript:
--   diset connection ob_query_timeout 600
-- For larger builds, select a measured timeout limit.
SET GLOBAL ob_query_timeout = 600000000;
SET SESSION ob_query_timeout = 600000000;
-- Only extend transaction timeout if a single transaction actually needs it;
-- changing query timeout does not extend an already-open transaction.
-- SET GLOBAL ob_trx_timeout = 600000000;
-- SET SESSION ob_trx_timeout = 600000000;

-- Build tuning candidate: allow packets up to 64 MiB. Reconnect the loaders
-- after changing a global variable. This does not increase client-side limits.
SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet = 67108864;

-- Existing TPROC-C data can have statistics retried without rebuilding it.
-- Replace tpcc with the configured database; run AFTER all loaders finish.
-- USE tpcc;
-- SET SESSION ob_query_timeout = 600000000;
-- ANALYZE TABLE customer, district, history, item, new_order,
--               orders, order_line, stock, warehouse;
-- Then run HammerDB Schema Check before starting a timed benchmark.

-- 2. TPROC-C MEASUREMENT PROFILE (business-tenant administrator)
-- Apply between runs, reconnect VUs, and compare the entire profile against
-- the recorded baseline with warehouse count/driver/duration held fixed.
-- Compare NOPM, response times, CPU, compaction and lock waits. To attribute
-- a change, restore the baseline and test individual settings separately.

-- MemStore freeze threshold candidate: 50 percent of the MemStore limit.
-- Relative to the recorded baseline, raising this value delays freezes and
-- lowering it triggers them sooner; memory pressure and background I/O change.
ALTER SYSTEM SET freeze_trigger_percentage = 50;

-- Concurrency candidate: 2 active workers per CPU quota. This may REDUCE concurrency.
-- Check the captured workers_per_cpu_quota and keep it greater than this value.
-- Confirm the benefit of this candidate with an A/B run.
ALTER SYSTEM SET cpu_quota_concurrency = 2;

-- Disable early lock release in this profile; throughput and lock waits may change.
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_early_lock_release = false;

-- Auto-increment candidates: NOORDER and a 10,000,000-value cache.
-- Applies to auto-increment columns, not the explicit district.d_next_o_id
-- sequence used to calculate HammerDB NOPM. IDs can have gaps / lack ordering.
ALTER SYSTEM SET default_auto_increment_mode = 'NOORDER';
SET GLOBAL auto_increment_cache_size = 10000000;

-- A value of 100 defers write throttling until the MemStore threshold is
-- reached. Consider ONLY with adequate memory/I/O headroom; this can increase
-- the risk of exhausting MemStore. Keep throttling enabled for the baseline.
-- ALTER SYSTEM SET writing_throttling_trigger_percentage = 100;

-- 3. VALUES NOT INCLUDED IN THE EXECUTABLE PROFILE
-- Larger SQL work-area and PX queuing limits are not included because they
-- must be sized for the tenant. Choose SQL work-area memory and PX concurrency
-- from tenant resources, especially for TPROC-H parallel queries.
-- SQL Audit/performance-event/trace-log disabling, OBProxy logging/protocol/QoS
-- changes and private underscore parameters are deliberately omitted: retain
-- diagnostics and proxy metrics for node-load analysis, and validate version-specific internal
-- parameters separately. No durability, locality or replica changes here.

-- 4. RESTORE / REPRODUCE
-- Restore each changed parameter/variable using the values in tuning-before.txt
-- and the SAME scope (ALTER SYSTEM / SET GLOBAL / SET SESSION) used above.
-- Reconnect after restoring global variables; restore HammerDB's connection
-- timeout too and reload its driver. Global changes do not update existing VUs.
-- Record applied settings and topology alongside the HammerDB Job/Profile ID.
-- Use the same settings in single-node and three-node comparison groups.
